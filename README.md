On the other hand, the test dataset contains data for 12 unseen trips, 6 each from category A and B. To normalize the training, validation and test datasets, min-max normalization has been used, with a scaling range of [-1,1].

## Vanilla RNN
The SimpleRNN and Dense layers of the Sequential module of the Keras library in Python were used to implement the Vanilla RNN.
* The activation functions used are as follows:
  * **Tanh or hyperbolic tangent** function for the **hidden layer(s)**
  * **Linear function** for the **output layer**
* **Mean squared error (MSE)** was used as the loss function as well as a performance metric
* Along with MSE, **R-squared (R2)** score was used as a performance metric
* **Stochastic gradient descent (SGD)** with **0.025** as the learning rate, was used as the optimizer

The optimal configuration for the Vanilla RNN model was determined using a trial and error approach, in which different configurations were trained for 100 epochs with 512 samples per batch, and their performance metrics were analysed. The configuration with the least possible MSE as well as highest possible R2 score was chosen as the optimal one.

## LSTM
The LSTM and Dense layers of the Sequential module of the Keras library in Python were used to implement the long short-term memory network. The activation functions, loss function, optimizer, learning rate and the performance metrics used are similar to the Vanilla RNN implementation, with the optimal configuration for the LSTM model also being determined in a similar fashion.

## GRU
The GRU and Dense layers of the Sequential module of the Keras library in Python were used to implement the gated recurrent unit network. The activation functions, loss function, optimizer, learning rate and the performance metrics used are similar to the Vanilla RNN implementation, with the optimal configuration for the GRU model also being determined in a similar fashion.

## Model Testing/Validation
The performance of the three optimal models was compared using the test datasets, as well as the remaining datasets that were not used for either training, validation or testing.

For the KNN Regressor, the best value of K was found by plotting the elbow curve for R2 scores versus different values of K.

## Conclusion 
The GRU model achieved the least MSE and highest R2 score than that of the other models and hence, it proved to be quite capable of accurately estimating the SoC of a battery operating under different conditions.
